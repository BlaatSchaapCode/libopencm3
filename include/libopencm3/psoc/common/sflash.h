// TODO: See if/where there are differences in SFLASH between versions
// See for example 4000, which has SRSS-Lite, having SFLASH_IMO_TCTRIM_LT0 values



// There are the values required for the clocking mechanism
// Todo: add all the other values
// Looking at the initial revision of the 4100/4200 TRM as they're removed
// in later revisions. They're also in the PSoC Analog Coprocessor TRM, and
// it looks like they match up, so for the time being we assume they're valid
// for all families.

// The 4100M/4200M series register TRM actually mentions where to apply these
// values, what goes where. 
// ABS?  goes to  PWR_BG_TRIM4
// TMPCO? goes to PWR_BG_TRIM5
// Also it shows the IMO_TRIM is the beginning of an "array", whth a value
// for each TRIM2 value. as there are 45 values, and the frequency range is
// 3..48, it is reasonable to assume we need offset "frequency - 3"
